* Twitter crawler
  This is a simple crawler that connects to a Twitter stream and sends the tweets to a running Rails app
** How to use it
   You must have an application registered on Twitter Apps, so you can have a consumer key, consumer secret, oauth token and oauth token secret.
   Export those as environment variables (named CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, OAUTH_TOKEN and OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)
   The Rails app "SumOneProject" must also be running on http://localhost:3000/
   After that, run
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   bundle install
   bundle exec ruby crawler.rb <your term>
   #+END_SRC
   And the script will start collecting tweets containing your term, sending them to the SumOneProject app.
